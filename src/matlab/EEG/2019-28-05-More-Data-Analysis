More Data Analysis
==================

Yesterday, we focused on observing the distribution of EEG data for
both headsets. Today, we looked at comparing the data over time.
What we found was more interesting and explains the weird 
difference we saw yesterday. 

Plotting EEG readings over time for each electrode revealed that from
epoch 0-400 and 600-1000, the readings from p3.gdf do not change 
whatsoever (stays around ~15). Between 400-600, activity between both
EEG headsets really begins. We were able to identify regions in which
activity from both headsets spikes at the same time, which may be 
evidence of syncornisation. Methods like PLS (phase locking 
synchronization) might be crucial in identifying syncronisation over
a longer period of time (direct comparison is over a second).

VR and PLV
==========

Today we discussed splitting the workload to introduce a new task.
I addition to automating the PLV pipeline (which Gus will primarily
work on over the next week and a half), I will be working on 
implementing the VR environment for the next two conditions
(VR face-to-face and VR first person view). We discussed with 
Ihshan and Amit on approximate deadlines to have to the tasks 
complete. I will be borrowing an HTC Vive to work on the 
environment at home with my VR ready machine (Ryzen 1600x +
GTX 1080) 
        
I will be brushing up on my C# knowledge and working in Unity.

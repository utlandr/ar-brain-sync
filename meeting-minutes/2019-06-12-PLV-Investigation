Phase locking value analysis
============================

We have been looking into better methods of detecting syncronisation.
Phase locking value attempts to match signals that display similar phase
at specifica points in time. This should in theory assist with data that
comes from different eeg headsets as PLVs doesnt rely on the sensitivity of
EEG readings, rather the phase of the waves. We found an implementation of
PLV using matlab and are going to adapt that to our own datasets. We also 
obtained raw EEG data (non-averaged) to work on.

Single Person VR Complete
=========================

Completed the single person VR environment. Using Unity's built in
Mechanim IK solver, I have successfully set hand and feet targets.
I am actually quite impressed with the result. The Humanoid model
is also capable of sitting. I solved the hand animation problem by
setting the animation to be additive instead of overiding so it 
doesnt mess with the other IK animations. 

The next major task is the networking. Having completed a tutorial
on it I have a reasonable understanding of what to do. How this
will appear in the code I have yet to figure out. Essentially, 
a two person connection requires the managing of 6 character models. 
2 for each local instance, and two for the remote instance. I have 
already tried some basic implmenmentation but the tracking is applied
over both character models (not just the one controlled by the player).
Also, I don't know how I will setup the models. I guessing that the 
ones on the server will have to act as 'puppets' to display to the
clients. In other words, IK solver runs on each client to determine
positions of the skeleton, then send that transform information to
the server. Not too sure how animations will work though...

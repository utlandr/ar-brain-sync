On the topic of PCA for EEG
===========================

Today we looked at principal component analysis for eeg data.
PCA (and Idepenpendt Component Analysis, ICA) on paper display
potential in either separating important eeg data from the
noise, or seperating regualar eeg activity from an 
activation. Gus has been looking at phase locking methods as
well as learning more about using eeglab.

We are going to attempt creating our own data (a baseline
EEG recording) to be used for testing.

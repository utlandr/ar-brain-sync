Completed Basic Local instance
==============================

So I think I have figured out a basic, local
setup. The player is able to teleport and rotate
on the spot (this will be used for the initial setup
as well as VR familiarity). Furthermore, pulling the
trigger on the controller initiates the pointing
animation. I have also made use of a free Unity Store
Asset called VRArmIK which implements a basic IK solver
for the shoulder and upper arms so that in the VR
scape, there is accurate elbow bending, shoulder rotation
and wrist protonation.

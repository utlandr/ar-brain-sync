VR from scratch
===============

I can't get Prisanths project to work for. I have devided to more or less
start from scratch. Techincally it wont be from scratch, I have alot of handy
assets available to me from the Unity Asset store and I have been making modifications
to some scripts developed by Prisanth and others. I have also gotten finger pointing 
animations working. My main tasks now consist of player movement, player model and 
networking.

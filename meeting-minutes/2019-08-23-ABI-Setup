ABI Setup
=========

With the core of the first player instance complete,
I am moving into the ABI to get help with networking.
So I have spent most of the day setting up on Floor 7
with personal machine, my monitor and peripherals. 
I have also been given a second machine and an 
HTC Vive pro which will be used for the second participant
setup. I have alos had a meeting with Amit and Ihshan and they 
have a couple of requests regarding the player model. Mainly, 
I need to make it look realistic and it must have some kind 
of sitting position with a chair to better emulate the 
experiment environment. 

For now, I will improve the player model once I have networking.

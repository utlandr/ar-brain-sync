PLV PIPELINE
============

### SCRIPT 1
1. Cut pairs into 4 files (baseline,pre, training, post) 
	-	Extracting epochs
	-	Put Baseline into one folder (folder for each)


### SCRIPT 2
2. Preprocessing of pairs
	-	FFT
	-	ICA
	- 	Noise Reduction
	-	Separate into different freq bands <- need to find out

3. Calculate PLV between pairs
	-	With each frequency grab each channel for each pair
	-	do for pre, training, post.

4. Doing statistical analysis
	-	Do with Chi Square.
	-	Then look at calculating PLV for all coupling.

Possible Things
	-	Possible look into loreta (plugin required). 
	-	How to video eeg data (eeglab)

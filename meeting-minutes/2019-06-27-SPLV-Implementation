SPLV Implementation
===================

I have implemented the Single sample Phase Locking Value algorithm. Currently,
the implementation is untested except for basic checks such as PLV's between
[0 1] and testing on randomly generated datasetss (which are not very good for
determining if the algorith works. My implementation is a modification of 
Prineeth Namburi's implementation (available via the MATLAB Central File 
Exchange) of PLV. The next stage is to test whether the SPLV can be used to at
least gain qualitative insight into brain syncronisation using the lab data 
providedf by the ABI.

Running EEG Code
================

We fixed the issue with the missing file ('p3.spl' which is a file specifying
electrode locations around the scalp for visualisations).

We ran Pawan and Nakul's project code, which is in of itself has a direct 
approach: 
 - The electrode readings at each second are averaged and compared to every
   other electrode both on the subject. 
 - For two electrode comparisons, if they are from different people and have a
   difference in signal below a threshold (0.01), the comparison is accepted
   as a potential brain synchronisation.
 - They also include a script (dualheadplot.m) that was created by researchers
   in Canada and Spain that produces a double head plot with connections.

Initial Analysis of the Method
==============================
While the aforementioned method of syncronisation detection is straight
forward, there are a couple of problems that it doesn't address.
Primarily, we noticed that no normalisation of the EEG data was performed.
Since this method relies on minimal absolute difference between two signals,
this could potentially mean that alot of possible syncornisations are left
out. Several factors can attribute to a systematic bias in either EEG dataset.
 
Averaging of the data across time intervals is a method of removing background
noise. However, this is a somewhat blind method of noise removal that also 
effectly reduces the amount of data we have to investigate synchronisation. It 
is also likely that averaging of the data over a second removes any possible
synchronisations within that second or creates false positives.

This code is important in realizing the necessity of a model that is robust in
high noise data, but is also capable of more complex ways to detect 
synchronisation. A method that comes to mind in these regards is Principal
Component Analysis (PCA).

More Networking and Modelling
=============================

Today I will be working on getting the HMD camera
to line up with the head of the model. This may
take some messing around with the original code
in which case I will make a fork of the original.

Got the HMD to line up. I also tried some shoulder
alteration techniques but to no avail. I just did 
a translation for the shoulder bladed a bit so the
arm doesnt go through the body too much. 

Now I have hit yet another problem. With just about 
everything working I am no longer able to get the 
hands to animate into a point. 

I intended to do networking today as the title
suggests, but I failed in that regard. I'm having
a hard time getting this to work.

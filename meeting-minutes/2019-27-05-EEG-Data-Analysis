EEG Data Analysis
=================

Observing some of the issues with the dataset for direct comparison,
we performed some base data analysis on the EEG data to observe some
patterns and possibly setup some type of normalization to improve
comparisons between the headsets (before applying a model). 

Plotting the distribution of readings across the entire experiment 
for both datasets we noticed that the distributions for p3.gdf and p4.
gdf are completey different, p3.gdf exhibits majority of readings 
between 14.9 to 15.1 (with some weird recordings of low/near-zero in 
some cases). p4.gdf on the other hand is completely different, in most
cases the data lies between 5-10. While this does indicate evidence 
that direct comparison between both datasets is a poor way to detect
syncronizations, we did notice a time period where data fluctuates
more around the middle of the experiment. 

So, we might need to crop some of the data/look at different time 
periods for better insight.

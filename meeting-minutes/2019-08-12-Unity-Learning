Unity Learning
==============

I have been loaned an HTC Vive to take home and work on a
Virtual reality scape for the next stage of the experiments. 
The reasoning behind this is that I will be able to work
from home using my personal machine which is VR ready. The ABI
currently does not have enough VR ready machines to distribute
to our experiment.

PLV Modifications
=================

Went through modifications to the PLV
pipeline: 
 
 - The datasets have different number of triggers (this due 
   to the computer the eeg data was recorded from). The 
   So for future reference, we ignore Out 1 event label.
 
 - Also learnt how to import split data by epoch
 - Must rename duplicate event type names so that epoch
   extraction behaves correctly.

 - I think we found a solution

Also learned how to perform the experiment pairs.
 - Recording eeg data from participants
 - 
 - Cleaning eeg equipment
 - Inserting gel into eeg channels
 -

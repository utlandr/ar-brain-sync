Meeting with Professor Billihurst
=================================

Notes before the meeting
========================
	What we have done:
	- We have read/reading Amit's recommended literature
	- We have met with Pawan and Nakul (BME students working on Brain Syncronisation) 

	Inquiries:
	- We want to know if meeting with the students and potentially continuuing on from some of their work is a good idea.
		- If it is a good idea, discuss how we can get access to some of their work.
	- Recommend experiements that are good for AR/VR (effect of background noise, etc)
	- Discuss possible limitations of AR/VR, particularly the technology available to US.

Meeting with Professor Billihurst
=================================

Notes before the meeting
========================
	What we have done:
	- We have read/reading Amit's recommended literature
	- We have met with Pawan and Nakul (BME students working on Brain Syncronisation) 

	Inquiries:
	- We want to know if meeting with the students and potentially continuuing on from some of their work is a good idea.
		- If it is a good idea, discuss how we can get access to some of their work.
	- Recommend experiements that are good for AR/VR (effect of background noise, etc)
	- Discuss possible limitations of AR/VR, particularly the technology available to US.

Meeting
=======
- Data analysis is there but more data is needed. 
- Fine tuning required of the code. Only uses one form of analysis. Need to add other forms of analysis. 
- ATM its simple. 
- Bergers. Hyperscanning cautionary tale. Important to focus on the methods of analysis. Might not have time to implement them all. 
- Finger pointing is one of the more popular testing methods. 
- Switching perspective is important (testing different exmaple)
- But there aren't many established methods. (we could investigate our own methods)
- Need to do some time estimation (finger tracking might be worth sticking to).
- Good method is to read it, memorise, write summary, compare. 
- Send Amit a copy before submission (The draft). 
- Applications
	- Training applications (Monitoring Device)
	- Can also work as a BCI (check if someone is paying attention)

- Research what happens when a task becmoes too complex. 
- Hardware/Software requirements. 
- Amit works on Brain Syncronisation and getting new hardware for streamlining the process.

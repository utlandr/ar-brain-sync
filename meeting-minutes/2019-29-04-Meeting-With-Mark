Meeting with Professor Billihurst
=================================

Notes before the meeting
	- We have read/reading Amit's recommended literature
	- We have met with Pawan and Rakur (BME students working on Brain Syncronisation) 
	- We want to know if meeting with the students and potentially continuuing on from some of their work is a good idea.
	- Recommend experiements that are good for AR/VR (effect of background noise, etc)
	- Discuss possible limitations of AR/VR, particularly the technology available to US.

Networking Basics
=================

Networking is not easy. I am following a tutorial that implements
Unity Networking for a simple scene (Non VR). Once I understand 
Networking for any 3d setup, in theory it should also be easy to
do VR (as this is more a less a glorified 3d environment). My
only concern is how the player scripts for arm movement
will interfer with the servers updates on position and rotation
of part. My other concern is how to enable functionality with
animations. 

It appears the common approach is to only send transform information.
Alternatively for the pointing animation. I can send the controller
event to which the server respond with activating the animation.

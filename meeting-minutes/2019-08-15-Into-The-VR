Into the VR scape
=================

I have completed a basic 7 hour tutorial on using
Unity3D. Now I am going to start working on the VR scape.
I have spent most of today getting the HTC Vive setup
(base stations, controller calibration). THis also
included a rather annoying 'bug' in SteamVR in which
it uses a Web application hosted on localhost:8998.
The only issues with this is that SteamVR doesn't 
detect whether that port is being used by another 
program. So I have to manually search and kill 
any tasks running on 8998 before I can calibrate cotrollers
or setup input mappings. So here is how to do it:

 - Identify the culprit program using netstat:
		netstat -ano | findstr :8998

- Kill the task:
		taskkill /PID <programid> /F

- Restart SteamVR

I have to do this everytime I setup SteamVR

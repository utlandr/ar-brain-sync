More Lab Data and PLV thoughts
==============================

We have recieved more data for the finger pointing experiment. I have 
implemented a function in MATLAB that will perform the correct importing of
data that comes from this experiment. Furthermore, I tested an example of PLV.
An issue that I am facing is that I underestimated how much data PLV requires
in the way of samples (which this experiment probably doesn't have enough of,
and even if it did, it is hard to replicated the finger experiment identically
for each pair several times over). What I have come across is a the S-PLV 
method which attempts to perform PLV on single sample (that is single 
experiment) at the cost of temporal resolution (taking the PLV across time
points. I will endeveour to alter the current implentation to perform this
analysis single sample calculation.

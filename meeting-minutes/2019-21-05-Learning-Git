Learning Git
============

We learned how to setup a remote repository for our code.
We now both have a copy of the project and a method of easily making
appropriate changes to the project. 

We also noticed that tracking eeglab makes the project a bit bloated so we
will make some changes to how we setup dependencies for the project.

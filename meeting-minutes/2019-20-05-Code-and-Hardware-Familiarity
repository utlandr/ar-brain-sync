Code and Hardware Familiarity
=============================

We met with Amit and Pawan to gain an understanding of the the hardware and 
software required to analyze eeg data. The two most important so far are:
 - OpenVIBE: An SDK for OpenBCI hardware that powers the eeg headsets. 
 	     This software is responsible for data recording and live tracking
	     of eeg signals.

 - EEGlab: A MATLAB toolkit designed to streamline several EEG dataset
           methods. This is what Amit and Nakul used to import and setup the 
	   EEG data and run dual head plots.


 
We also learned how to use the EEG headset to import data. Here are some of
the important settings (after inserting the USB dongle and opening OpenVIBE 
data acquisition server): 
 - Driver: OpenBCI 
 
 - Driver Properties: 
 	- Device: \\.\COM6
	- Use Daisy Module: Ticked
 
 - Preferences: 
 	- Drift Correction: Let the driver decide
	- Drift Tolerance: 10s 

 - Connection Port: 1024
 
 - Sample count per sent block: 64


Also we set up the data saver and viewer diagram on OpenViBE Designer:
 - Drag an acquisition client into the setup.
 - Drag a Signal Display object to the setup.
 - Connect In/Out pins. (Purple/Pink triagles). 


Amit also provided us with a couple of datasets to run the syncronisation.
He also referenced the paper that they followed:
  - Title: Brain-to-brain entrainment: EEG interbrain synchronization while speaking and listening.
  - By: Alejandro Perez, Manuel Carreiras

This paper is also responsible for the double head visualisation.

Amit recommends we follow a 45 OpenVIBE tutorial.

We will need to contact Pawan again to discuss some of the missing files. When 
running their main script, `double_headplot` required a p3.spl (spline file). 
We will also need to do more research as to file types and conventions in EEG.

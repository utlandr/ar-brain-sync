More Networking and connection troubles
=======================================

I have been having issues getting the two pcs to
talk to each other wihtin the Unity application. 
I have also brought a spare router I own to setup
better data transfer between pcs (though in theory,
I don't need DHCP and can set static IP's thus a 
direct ethernet connection is all that is necessary).

Finally got them to communicate and run the basic 
netwoking application I have been learning from. 
The issues I was having is by default, the Host 
server wants to setup on localhost (127.0.0.1). So 
the host client connects fine, but any other client wont
be able to (localhost will never communicate with other pcs).

I found an option in the NetworkManager Inspector element that
ties the server to an IP address, once I was able to do that, the
server accepted client connections fine. I will continue with 
the tutorial and then get into the VR implementation. 

Completed the networking tutorial and have made improvements
in my model implementation. Also found a abetter IK 
implementation that ties to a humanoid model. Just need 
to fix the camera positioning. Arms work great.

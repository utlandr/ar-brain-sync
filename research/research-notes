Intro

Just taking notes for all the research I have read. The reason I use
vim is that I can quickly jot down notes into the terminal as I would
be able to using a physical notepad. I can also track times accessed
and subsequent updates via the git versioning system. I might consider 
using LaTeX in the future which will allow me to using mathematical
notation.

	Abstract
	========

	Electroencephalographic  measurements  are  commonly  used  in  medical  and  
	research  areas.  This  review  article  presents  an  introduction  into  
	EEG  measurement.  Its  purpose  is  to  help  with  orientation  in  EEG  field  
	and  with  building  basic  knowledge  for  performing  EEG  recordings.  
	The  article  is  divided  into  two  parts.  In  the  first  part,  background  
	of  the  subject,  a  brief  historical  overview, and some EEG related research 
	areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording.

-	E.E.G. (= Electronoencephalography) is an imaging scanning technique that reads 
	scalp energy generated by brain structures.

-	When brain cells are activated, local electrical current flows. EEG picks up 
	information primarily from the dendrites of pyramidical nerons in the cerebral
	cortex.

-	Gradient potentials of ions (Na+, K+, Cl++, Cl-) 

-	Only large numbers of neuronal activaty can be picked up by EEG as the electrical
	current must be strong enough to perpetrate through layers of skin, skull and 
	others. 

-	For our purposes, we can divide the brain into three parts, cerebrum, cerebellum
	and brain stem:
	
	Cerebrum -	Consists of the left and right hemispheres with a surface layer 
			Cerebral Cortex. This thing is good for movement init, 
			awareness, analysis and expression of emotions.

	Cerebellum -	Coordinates voluntary movements of muscles and

Intro
=====

Just taking notes for all the research I have read. The reason I use
vim is that I can quickly jot down notes into the terminal as I would
be able to using a physical notepad. I can also track times accessed
and subsequent updates via the git versioning system. I might consider 
using LaTeX in the future which will allow me to using mathematical
notation.

	Abstract
	========

	Electroencephalographic  measurements  are  commonly  used  in  medical  and  
	research  areas.  This  review  article  presents  an  introduction  into  
	EEG  measurement.  Its  purpose  is  to  help  with  orientation  in  EEG  field  
	and  with  building  basic  knowledge  for  performing  EEG  recordings.  
	The  article  is  divided  into  two  parts.  In  the  first  part,  background  
	of  the  subject,  a  brief  historical  overview, and some EEG related research 
	areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording. 


	Keywords 
	========

	Electroencephalography, EEG, brain waves, EEG recording, EEG amplifiers

-	E.E.G. (= Electronoencephalography) is an imaging scanning technique that reads 
	scalp energy generated by brain structures.

-	When brain cells are activated, local electrical current flows. EEG picks up 
	information primarily from the dendrites of pyramidical nerons in the cerebral
	cortex.

-	Gradient potentials of ions (Na+, K+, Cl++, Cl-) 

-	Only large numbers of neuronal activaty can be picked up by EEG as the electrical
	current must be strong enough to perpetrate through layers of skin, skull and 
	others. 

-	For our purposes, we can divide the brain into three parts, cerebrum, cerebellum
	and brain stem:
	
	Cerebrum -	Consists of the left and right hemispheres with a surface layer 
			Cerebral Cortex. This thing is good for movement init, 
			awareness, analysis and expression of emotions.

	Cerebellum -	Coordinates voluntary movements of muscles and and balance
			maintainance.

	Brain Stem - 	Controls respiration, heart regulation, biorythms, neuro-
			hormone and hormone secretion.

	The highest electrical activity comes from the cerebral cortex due to its 
	proximity to the skull surface.


EEG
===

-	Electriacl currents in the brain discovered in 1875 by a one Richard Caton.
-	Rabbits and Monkeys were harmed in the making of his discoveries.
-	1924 saw the successfull amplification of the brain's electrical activity using
	radio equipment.
-	In 1934 Adiran and Matthews published the paper verifying the concept of brain
	waves and identified regular oscillation around 10 to 12 Hz which are now known
	as 'alpha rythms'

Brain Waves Classification
==========================

-	Subjects are instructed to close their eyes and relax
-	Brain patterns are sinusoidal
-	range from 0.5 to 100 uV in amplitude (100 times lower than EEG signals)
-	Can use fourier transforms to find the power spectrum from raw signal
-	Although continuous, from 0 to half of the freq, the brain state
	of the individial may cause overpowering of certain freqs

-	The Brain waves are divided as follows:
	
	beta >13Hz
	alpha 8-13Hz
	theta 4-8Hz
	delta 0.5-4Hz

-	Alpha is the most studied:
	-	observed in the occipital region
	-	50 uV amp (peak-to-peak)
	-	Induced by relaxation and closing the eyes (causes beta to alpha transfer)
	-	Precise origin is not known

-	When active, Beta is supreme
-	When calm/drowsy Alpha is alpha
-	Sleep induces lower frequencies

Sleep 
=====

-	NREM and REM (non-rapid/rapid eye movement)
-	REM occurs in cycles
-	NREM is divided in I, II, III and IV stages (last two attributed to deep sleep)

-	It is possible to distinguish individual behaviour/personality via EGG scans
	subjects regarded as 'rational' or 'intuitive' will display hicher activity in their
	frontal lobe

Clinical Applications
=====================

-	Monitor alertness/coma/brain death
-	Locate areas of damage due to head injury
-	Test pathways 
-	Monitor congitive engagement
-	Produce biofeedback situations
-	Control anaesthesia
-	Investigate epilepsy and locate seizure origin
-	Test epilepsy drug effects
.... List goes on


-	Symmetry of alpha activity within hemispheres is a good way of monitoring
	or detecting lesions

EEG Signal Distortion
=====================

-	Reduction in amplitude
-	Decrease of dominant freqs beyond normal limit
-	Spikes
-	In epileptics, these spikes can be extremely high (1000 uV)

Quatitative electroencephalography
==================================
- 	QEEG maps EEG information from the entire head region
- 	This allows one to determine spatial abnormalities

EEG Recording techniques
========================
- Employs a systemd consisting of:
	- Electrodes with conductive media
	- amplifiers with filters
	- A/D converter
	- recording device

- Electrodes read the signals from the head surface
- Amplifiers bring the microvolt signals into the range where they can be digitized
- converter converts analog signal to digital
- PC stores and displays data

- The electrode system can support 10-20 electrode placements
- Recordings at each electrode can be associated with the region of the brain it is located at
- There are also reference electrodes that help with the averaging of information
- reference electrode can be located in a variety of places such as the vertex (Cz) or the ears

- Amplifier information is indepth. Wont look at it for now as I'm not sure how much we need to know that

- Filtering looks important, predominantly use FIR or IIR as to not distort wave phases

Common causes of artifacting
============================

- Patient related:
	- Body movement
	- EMG
	- ECG (pulse/pacemaker)
	- eye movements
	- sweating

- Technical:
	- 50/60Hz 
	- impedence fluctuation
	- cable movement
	- broken wire contacts
	- too much eletrode jelly or lack thereof (or even inconsistancy)
	- low battery

Extra
=====

Analog filters recommended:
	- high pass filter with a cut off frequency between 0.1 and 0.7Hz
	- low pass filter with cut-off of less than half of the sampling rate
	- frequencise above 50/hz are rarely involved as the contribute negligibly

Converter:
	- at least 12 bit
	- accuracy lower than overall noise (0.3-2uV) 
	- sampling freq between 128-1024Hz

Digital filters: 
	- Digital high pass FIR filter with similar cutoff as analog high pass.

Just taking notes for all the research I have read. The reason I use
vim is that I can quickly jot down notes into the terminal as I would
be able to using a physical notepad. I can also track times accessed
and subsequent updates via the git versioning system. I might consider 
using LaTeX in the future which will allow me to using mathematical
notation.

	Abstract
	========

	Electroencephalographic  measurements  are  commonly  used  in  medical  and  
	research  areas.  This  review  article  presents  an  introduction  into  
	EEG  measurement.  Its  purpose  is  to  help  with  orientation  in  EEG  field  
	and  with  building  basic  knowledge  for  performing  EEG  recordings.  
	The  article  is  divided  into  two  parts.  In  the  first  part,  background  
	of  the  subject,  a  brief  historical  overview, and some EEG related research 
	areas are given. The second part explains EEG recording. 


	Keywords 
	========

	Electroencephalography, EEG, brain waves, EEG recording, EEG amplifiers

-	E.E.G. (= Electronoencephalography) is an imaging scanning technique that reads 
	scalp energy generated by brain structures.

-	When brain cells are activated, local electrical current flows. EEG picks up 
	information primarily from the dendrites of pyramidical nerons in the cerebral
	cortex.

-	Gradient potentials of ions (Na+, K+, Cl++, Cl-) 

-	Only large numbers of neuronal activaty can be picked up by EEG as the electrical
	current must be strong enough to perpetrate through layers of skin, skull and 
	others. 

-	For our purposes, we can divide the brain into three parts, cerebrum, cerebellum
	and brain stem:
	
	Cerebrum -	Consists of the left and right hemispheres with a surface layer 
			Cerebral Cortex. This thing is good for movement init, 
			awareness, analysis and expression of emotions.

	Cerebellum -	Coordinates voluntary movements of muscles and and balance
			maintainance.

	Brain Stem - 	Controls respiration, heart regulation, biorythms, neuro-
			hormone and hormone secretion.

	The highest electrical activity comes from the cerebral cortex due to its 
	proximity to the skull surface.


EEG
===

-	Electriacl currents in the brain discovered in 1875 by a one Richard Caton.
-	Rabbits and Monkeys were harmed in the making of his discoveries.
-	1924 saw the successfull amplification of the brain's electrical activity using
	radio equipment.
-	In 1934 Adiran and Matthews published the paper verifying the concept of brain
	waves and identified regular oscillation around 10 to 12 Hz which are now known
	as 'alpha rythms'

Brain Waves Classification
==========================

-	Subjects are instructed to close their eyes and relax
-	Brain patterns are sinusoidal
-	range from 0.5 to 100 uV in amplitude (100 times lower than EEG signals)
-	Can use fourier transforms to find the power spectrum from raw signal
-	Although continuous, from 0 to half of the freq, the brain state
	of the individial may cause overpowering of certain freqs

-	The Brain waves are divided as follows:
	
	beta >13Hz
	alpha 8-13Hz
	theta 4-8Hz
	delta 0.5-4Hz

-	Alpha is the most studied:
	-	observed in the occipital region
	-	50 uV amp (peak-to-peak)
	-	Induced by relaxation and closing the eyes (causes beta to alpha transfer)
	-	Precise origin is not known

-	When active, Beta is supreme
-	When calm/drowsy Alpha is alpha
-	Sleep induces lower frequencies

Sleep 
=====

-	NREM and REM (non-rapid/rapid eye movement)
-	REM occurs in cycles
-	NREM is divided in I, II, III and IV stages (last two attributed to deep sleep)

-	It is possible to distinguish individual behaviour/personality via EGG scans
	subjects regarded as 'rational' or 'intuitive' will display hicher activity in their
	frontal lobe

Clinical Applications
=====================

-	Monitor alertness/coma/brain death
-	Locate areas of damage due to head injury
-	Test pathways 
-	Monitor congitive engagement
-	Produce biofeedback situations
-	Control anaesthesia
-	Investigate epilepsy and locate seizure origin
-	Test epilepsy drug effects
.... List goes on


-	Symmetry of alpha activity within hemispheres is a good way of monitoring
	or detecting lesions

EEG Signal Distortion
=====================

-	Reduction in amplitude
-	Decrease of dominant freqs beyond normal limit
-	Spikes
-	In epileptics, these spikes can be extremely high (1000 uV)

Quatitative electroencephalography
==================================
- 	QEEG maps EEG information from the entire head region
- 	This allows one to determine spatial abnormalities

EEG Recording techniques
========================
- Employs a systemd consisting of:
	- Electrodes with conductive media
	- amplifiers with filters
	- A/D converter
	- recording device

- Electrodes read the signals from the head surface
- Amplifiers bring the microvolt signals into the range where they can be digitized
- converter converts analog signal to digital
- PC stores and displays data

- The electrode system can support 10-20 electrode placements
- Recordings at each electrode can be associated with the region of the brain it is located at
- There are also reference electrodes that help with the averaging of information
- reference electrode can be located in a variety of places such as the vertex (Cz) or the ears

- Amplifier information is indepth. Wont look at it for now as I'm not sure how much we need to know that

- Filtering looks important, predominantly use FIR or IIR as to not distort wave phases

Common causes of artifacting
============================

- Patient related:
	- Body movement
	- EMG
	- ECG (pulse/pacemaker)
	- eye movements
	- sweating

- Technical:
	- 50/60Hz 
	- impedence fluctuation
	- cable movement
	- broken wire contacts
	- too much eletrode jelly or lack thereof (or even inconsistancy)
	- low battery

Extra
=====

Analog filters recommended:
	- high pass filter with a cut off frequency between 0.1 and 0.7Hz
	- low pass filter with cut-off of less than half of the sampling rate
	- frequencise above 50/hz are rarely involved as the contribute negligibly

Converter:
	- at least 12 bit
	- accuracy lower than overall noise (0.3-2uV) 
	- sampling freq between 128-1024Hz

Digital filters: 
	- Digital high pass FIR filter with similar cutoff as analog high pass.

	Abstract
	========
        For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world – a brain–computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10–25 bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.

- This papers looks into the viability of using brain-computer interfaces for those that have impaired 
  communication/control. There are 3 options for restorting function:
	- Increase the capabilities of the remaingin pathways. The idea here is that the body in some
	  aspects is capable of covering loss / inhibition else. This is seen in muscles. Hence, a 
	  body part replaces a lost function.

	- The second option is to restore function by detouring around the breaks in the neural pathway
	  that controls muscles. EMG (electromygraphic) activity from muscles above the level of a lesion
	  can control electrical stimulation restore movement.

	- The final option (the kicker) is to provide the brain with a new, non-muscular communication 
	  that is direct using a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). EEG is capable of covering this method.
	  EEG is also the only practical method.

The present review
==================

- There exists dependent and independent BCIs:
	- Dependent BCIs do not use the brain's normal output pathways to carry the message. Rather, 
	  the activity in these pathways is required to generate the brain activity that does carry it. 
	  Thus BCI's are somewhat reactionary. For example, one dependent BCI presents a user with a
	  matrix of leters that flash one at a time. The user selects a specific letter by looking
	  directly at it. This results in an evoked potential that is higher than other letters.
	  Note here that EEG is used to detect this, but it requires the gaze of the user to actally 
	  work. 

	- Independent BCIs are in direct contrast. Take the same example (flashing letters) except, 
	  we observe that when a user selects a letter, there is a jump in brain activity for a 
	  specific region/electrode. Once again, EEG is used to detect this, but the message carried
	  did not depend gaze, but rather the users intent. 

- Interesting note here. BCI is a skill, like anything else, one will struggle to use it initially, 
  but as they use it more, they become more proficient. This can cause slight alterations to brain
  activity that requires BCI's to be adaptive and specific to a user's progression.

The BCI system
==============

1. Signal acquisition - Signal is retrieved and digitized using EEG 

2. Signal processing - Feature extraction and translation algorithm <- oh boy I have seen this before
		       in speaker authentication.

3. Generate Device commands and execute.

- Note here that the feature extraction is extremely broad and the data can be in almost any form
  
- Translation algorithm is also varied in approach. Can be as simple as linear statistical 
  regression or become as convoluted as neural networks. It is important that I take a simple
  approach first before getting too complex and convoluted. 

- The algorithm has to capable of filtering out the noise that is EEG signal variation due to
  a variety of factors not related to the task. Factors include:
	- Time of day
	- Hormonal levels
	- immediate environment
	- recent events 
	- fatigue

- The first immediate adaptation is to the users brain signals. For example, 
  if the signal is specific to a range,the BCI should be able to use that information

- Often a BCI uses periodic online adjustments to data based on short term / immediate 
  conditions that can be recorded. This is the second level of adaptation

- The final level of adaptation is recording effective operation. After a signal is 
  recieved and operation takes place, the resulting successfull / unsucessful operation
  will result in sebsequent activity. This information can also be used for adjustment,
  or providing a user with a reward.

Present Day BCI's
=================

There are 5 groups of BCI's:
	- VEP BCI - use the visual evoked potential that is produced by brief visual
	  stimuli recorded over the visual cortex. This is an example of a dependent
	  BCI that often requires/depends on the users gaze. This method is capable 
	  of enabling users to communicate at 10-12 words a minute. 

	- SCP BCI - Slow cortical potential BCI's leverage slow voltage changes.
		    This system is often used to re-enforce decisions over time in by 
		    observing subsequent voltage increase / decrease. 


	- Interesting information, the P300 response is a typical/naive response to a desired 
  	  choice. This is inherent in all humans. However as a user progresses, the P300 
  	  response can drastically improve or deteriorate. P300 BCIs have been made for this

Mu and beta rhythms and other activity from sensorimoter cortex
==============================================================

	- Between 8-12 Hz (remember) activity is present someone is doing nothing. 
	  BCI's have been made for this as the rhythms often intesect with movement.

	- The Wadsworth BCI - Individuals can control mu and beta rhythms to create
	  2d dimensional control. Linear equations are used to determine the 
	  prominence of both beta and mu rythms around the brain 10 times/s.
	
		- Sidenote here, the r^2 parameter can be used to determine how much 
		  control a user has of the cursor. 

	- The Graz BCI - For each imagined action, an n-dimensional feature vector is
	  		 derived. Here one can use linear discriminant analysis or other
			 to determine the action a user is trying to do.

	Abstract 
	========
	
	After Pierre Gloor and Hans Berger discovered the
	human electroencephalogram or EEG produced in the
	brain in 1969, Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) became
	a reality. However, for more than a couple of decades,
	besides the common social fascination with such devices,
	they have not yet been considered as a feasible alternative
	interface for common daily activities. This is attributed to
	issues such as response time, costs and long initial user
	training periods. This paper defines and outlines the
	current BCI technologies and reviews the current status
	of BCIs in the context of wearable computers. The use of
	Augmented Reality environments and the integration of
	wireless technologies such as Bluetooth are proposed as
	potential catalysts in the process of incorporating BCIs
	into daily life.

- Here they investigate the feasibility of a wireless BCI 



Bluetooth Feasibility
=====================

- Bluetooth offers a fast, low power and interference resistant method of wireless communication
- It is also compatible with alot of devices


Potential EEG trigger methods
=============================

- P300 responses are generally more reliable as a BCI method. In order for P300 responses
  to happen, a significant event has to occur that stands out from other options (which
  correlates well with a user's desired option/object)

- The downside is that a P300 response can also be evoked when a user has an unrelated 
  memory of an object/option that they do not want to select.

- Steady Visual Evoked Potentials also offer an attract solution. By using icons with a 
  unique strobing/falshing effect, EEG over the visual cortex will respond at a similar
  rate. 


Design
======

- Current EEG headsets are unweildy (that said, I have seen embedded electrodes in a VR
  headset that looked very effective). Design difficulties may rather pertain to the 
  VR headset itself rather than the EEG electrodes.

- Interesting point: The use of VR/AR can potentially maintain a 'lab-like' environemnt
  which may improve signal detection in an otherwise noisy realistic environment. 

- It has been shown that performing an activity with a BCI in a real environment is 
  drastically worse compared to an AR/VR scape.


My thoughts
===========

Very brief an intersting paper. The idea that AR/VR reduces background noise when
operating a BCI is very attractive. It would be interesting to see how brain 
syncronisation ties into this theory. However, the issue of BCI design to me is something
that is reliant on VR/AR harware (which is still bulky and unwieldy compared to the ideal
design of seamless glasses.

	A new methodology for the measurement of the neu-
	ral substrates of human social interaction is de-
	scribed. This technology, termed “Hyperscan,” embod-
	ies both the hardware and the software necessary to
	link magnetic resonance scanners through the inter-
	net. Hyperscanning allows for the performance of hu-
	man behavioral experiments in which participants
	can interact with each other while functional MRI is
	acquired in synchrony with the behavioral interac-
	tions. Data are presented from a simple game of decep-
	tion between pairs of subjects. Because people may
	interact both asymmetrically and asynchronously,
	both the design and the analysis must accommodate
	this added complexity. Several potential approaches
	are described. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)

What is the point in Hyperscanning?
===================================

Hyperscanning provides a method of simultaneous monitoring of two EEG headsets. This 
enables one to obseve relationships/features between EEG signals and tie them to a 
physical stimulus.

One of the potential issues with Hyperscanning is the difference in environment. Since 
the experiment was conducted online, simulatneuous EEG data was recorded for 
individuals in different surrounding environments. This could impact certain responses

Methods of correlation include:
	- PCA (Principal Components Analysis)
	- IDA (Independent Components Analysis)
	- PLS (Partial Least Squares)

But these methods will not identify temporally dynamic processes. LDA can kinda do this
but it is restricted to activity modes that are temporally correlated.

Weighing different brain and signals is also tricky. Method used here is to get an 
estimate a signal to noise ration for each brain and weigh accordingly.

Online latency can also be an issue. This paper experienced latencies between 300-400 ms
which is relatively low (especially for the task they were given). However, I estimate 
that one could get away with comparing signals as they appear to occur.

	Abstract

	Until now, in EEG studies the activity of the brain
	during simple or complex tasks have been recorded in a single
	subject. Often, during such EEG recordings, subjects interacts
	with the external devices or the researchers in order to
	reproduce conditions similar to the those usually occurring in
	the real-life. However, in order to study the concurrent activity
	in subjects interacting in cooperation or competition activities,
	the issue of the simultaneous recording of their brain activity
	became mandatory. The simultaneous recording of
	hemodynamic or neuroelectric activity of the brain is called
	“hyperscanning”. We would like present results obtained by
	EEG hyperscannings performed on a group of subjects
	engaged in cooperative games. The EEG hyperscannings have
	been performed with the simultaneous use of high resolution
	EEG devices on groups of three and four subjects while they
	were playing cooperative games. The analysis of such data have
	been conducted with analysis method that taken into account
	the particular nature of the data simultaneously gathered from
	different subjects.. We called these methods hypermethods. In
	particular, we estimate the concurrent activity in multiple
	brains of the group and we depicted the causal connections
	between regions of different brains (hyperconnectivity). The
	resulting causality patterns will link certain areas of the brain
	of a subject to the waveforms obtained from the other brain
	areas of another subject of the same group. Results obtained
	in a study of several groups recorded by the hyperscanning
	reveals causal links between prefrontal areas of the different
	subjects when they are performing cooperative games in
	different frequency bands. Hypermethods for hyperscanning
	will open a different area for the study of neuroscience, in
	which the activity of multiple brains during social cooperation
	could be investigated. In such area the importance of EEG will
	be relevant due to its temporal and spatial resolution now
	obtainable with the high resolution EEG techniques.

- Hyperscanning has the potential to quatifiably measure cooperation.

- Hyperscanning has use in game theory to analyze 'tit for tat' scenarios like the 
  prisoners dilemma. Furthermore, there is the oppotunity to investigate social
  interactions and concepts such as exclusion and prejudice.

- in this study, a group of people play an Italian card game called 'tressette'. The goal
  is that the 4 players (2 teams of 2) must play cards in a circle until the best card 
  wins. More importantly, the cooperation between 2 players stimulates activity in 
  cortical regions. 

- A Multivariate Autoregressive Model (MVAR) is used to identify coherent activity in 
  Regions of Interest (ROI's). The advantage of MVAR being that it is independent of 
  ROI and can be applied to any part of the brain.

- Here, the study uses outdegree to measure the hyperconnectivity of one ROI to all 
  and indegree to determine the amount of connectivity from all areas to one ROI.

- In conclusion, hyperscanning was found to be effective in identifying activity 
  asscoiated with a leader-group dynamic (in this game the first player of the game
  placing a card on the board).

	Abstract
	========
	
	One may have experienced his or her footsteps unconsciously synchronize with the footsteps of a friend
	while walking together, or heard an audience’s clapping hands naturally synchronize into a steady rhythm.
	However, the mechanisms of body movement synchrony and the role of this phenomenon in implicit
	interpersonal interactions remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate unconscious body movement synchrony
	changes as an index of implicit interpersonal interaction between the participants, and also to assess the
	underlying neural correlates and functional connectivity among and within the brain regions. We found that
	synchrony of both fingertip movement and neural activity between the two participants increased after
	cooperative interaction. These results suggest that the increase of interpersonal body movement synchrony
	via interpersonal interaction can be a measurable basis of implicit social interaction. The paradigm provides
	a tool for identifying the behavioral and the neural correlates of implicit social interaction.


This paper describes the finger pointing syncronous experment. It found that post check
syncronisation was thoroughly better and more concise (smaller error margin) than pre-
check and cross check routine (where users are mixed up without prior training). 

Regions of interest were right inferior parietal and posterioi temporal cortex which have
been observed to be important in social cognition aspects like empathy. They are also
active in low-level computational processes associated with the sense of agency.
